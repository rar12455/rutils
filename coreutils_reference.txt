DELAYING
--------

VERSIONING
----------

All coreutils have:
--help      - Display help and exit
--version   - Output version information and exit


NOTES
-----

1. These utilities form the core of any Unix-like operating system
2. They're designed to do one thing well and work together via pipes
3. Most accept standard input and produce standard output
4. They follow the Unix philosophy of small, composable tools
5. Many have POSIX-specified behavior with GNU extensions
6. Options typically use both short (-a) and long (--all) forms

IMPLEMENTATION TIPS
-------------------

When implementing your own versions:
- Start with simpler utilities (cat, echo, true, false)
- Focus on core functionality first, add options later
- Handle errors gracefully
- Support reading from stdin when no files specified
- Test with edge cases (empty files, large files, special characters)
- Consider buffering for performance
- Follow POSIX standards where applicable
- Add --help and --version early
